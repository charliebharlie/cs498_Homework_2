Implementation Details:
The project uses Node.js to host the server and Firestore for the database. Whenever a HTTP request comes in, depending on the request type, the Node.js server will interact with the Firestore database that I named 'hw2-pt2'. 

File Structure:
server.js: The server code deployed to both instances
analysis.py: Script used to measure latency and consistency
Team_HW2.txt: My netID.
IPs.txt: A space-separated list of the external IP addresses of your two Cloud instances.
Code_HW2.txt: A file describing your implementation and file structure.
Analysis.txt:
    The average latency measurements from Part IV-A.
    The results from your eventual consistency experiment in Part IV-B (i.e., how many times the username was not found).
    A brief (1–2 paragraph) discussion of your findings. Why do you think the latencies differ? What does your consistency experiment show?
